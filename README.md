# bijou

A lightweight freamwork based on [fastai course](https://course.fast.ai) for training pytorch models conveniently, especially for [Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.08434.pdf).

## Main features
- For Graph Neural Network models
  - It is compatible with [PyG](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_geometric) Dataloader for Graph Neural Networks for graph classification and other graph level learning, 
  - It can be used in node level learning with sigle [PyG Data](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/data.html).
- Easily to Use
    - It is like [FastAI](https://docs.fast.ai) but far more lightweight. 

## Install

- `pip install bijou`

### Dependency

  - Pytorch
  - Matplotlib
  - Networkx
  - Numpy
  - tqdm
  - torch-geometric (optional)

## Examples

1. MNIST

```python
